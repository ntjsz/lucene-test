This book is not comprehensive in covering all topics related to information retrieval. We have put aside a number of topics, which we deemed outside the scope of what we wished to cover in an introduction to information retrieval class. Nevertheless, for people interested in these topics, we provide a few pointers to mainly textbook coverage here.
