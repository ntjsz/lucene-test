queryexpansionlink build on the foundation of the first eight chapters to cover a variety of more advanced topics. Chapter 9 discusses methods by which retrieval can be enhanced through the use of techniques like relevance feedback and query expansion, which aim at increasing the likelihood of retrieving relevant documents. Chapter 10 considers information retrieval from documents that are structured with markup languages like XML and HTML. We treat structured retrieval by reducing it to the vector space scoring methods developed in Chapter 6 . Chapters 11 12 invoke probability theory to compute scores for documents on queries. Chapter 11 develops traditional probabilistic information retrieval, which provides a framework for computing the probability of relevance of a document, given a set of query terms. This probability may then be used as a score in ranking. Chapter 12 illustrates an alternative, wherein for each document in a collection, we build a language model from which one can estimate a probability that the language model generates a given query.
