nbayeshierclust give a treatment of various forms of machine learning and numerical methods in information retrieval. nbayessvm treat the problem of classifying documents into a set of known categories, given a set of documents along with the classes they belong to. Chapter 13 motivates statistical classification as one of the key technologies needed for a successful search engine, introduces Naive Bayes, a conceptually simple and efficient text classification method, and outlines the standard methodology for evaluating text classifiers. Chapter 14 employs the vector space model from Chapter 6 and introduces two classification methods, Rocchio and kNN, that operate on document vectors. It also presents the bias-variance tradeoff as an important characterization of learning problems that provides criteria for selecting an appropriate method for a text classification problem. Chapter 15 introduces support vector machines, which many researchers currently view as the most effective text classification method. We also develop connections in this chapter between the problem of classification and seemingly disparate topics such as the induction of scoring functions from a set of training examples.
