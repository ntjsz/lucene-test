flatclust lsi consider the problem of inducing clusters of related documents from a collection. In Chapter 16 , we first give an overview of a number of important applications of clustering in information retrieval. We then describe two flat clustering algorithms: the $K$-means algorithm, an efficient and widely used document clustering method; and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which is computationally more expensive, but also more flexible. Chapter 17 motivates the need for hierarchically structured clusterings (instead of flat clusterings) in many applications in information retrieval and introduces a number of clustering algorithms that produce a hierarchy of clusters. The chapter also addresses the difficult problem of automatically computing labels for clusters. Chapter 18 develops methods from linear algebra that constitute an extension of clustering, and also offer intriguing prospects for algebraic methods in information retrieval, which have been pursued in the approach of latent semantic indexing.
