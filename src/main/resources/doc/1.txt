This book is the result of a series of courses we have taught at Stanford University and at the University of Stuttgart, in a range of durations including a single quarter, one semester and two quarters. These courses were aimed at early-stage graduate students in computer science, but we have also had enrollment from upper-class computer science undergraduates, as well as students from law, medical informatics, statistics, linguistics and various engineering disciplines. The key design principle for this book, therefore, was to cover what we believe to be important in a one-term graduate course on information retrieval. An additional principle is to build each chapter around material that we believe can be covered in a single lecture of 75 to 90 minutes.
